# 2. File Contents: .html, .py, .js Extensions

__**html:**__

A) User Route:
1. `index.html`   
2. `home_products.html` 
     - displayed all products currently in the system
     - added a checkbox functionality to filter out the products
3. `cart.html`
4. `create_checkout_session.html`
5. `success_transaction.html`
6. `failure_transaction.html`
7. 
8. `product_details.html`
9.  `profile.html`
B) Admin Route:    
1.  `admin_products.html` 
      - displayed all current products encompassing the CRUD operations 
      - added Pagination functionality at the end of the page
2.  `admin_user.html` showed all registered users excluding the admin person

__**py:**__
1. `admin.py`:
      - This file registers the `User, Product, Cart, CartItem, Like, and Order` models with the Django admin site. As a result, these models can be managed via the Django admin interface, allowing administrators to view, add, modify, and delete instances of these models through a web-based interface.
2. `context_processors.py`
      - Defines a context processor function `send_cart_length` that provides cart-related information to all **templates**. Specifically, it adds the total number of items in the cart (cart_length) and the total price of the items in the cart (total) to the context. This function is registered in the settings.py as follows
  
      ```python
            'context_processors': [
                ...
                'eCoffee.context_processors.send_cart_length'
            ],
      ```
3. `forms.py`
      - The forms.py file defines a ProductForm class that inherits from forms.ModelForm. This form is used to create or update instances of the Product model.

      - The Meta class within ProductForm specifies that the form is based on the Product model.
      The form includes the fields `description, category, price, quantity, and photo_url` from the `Product` model. The Django form itself serves as a `Constructor` of the `Product` class.
4. `models.py`
      - Consists of core models of the backbone project
      - `User`: Extends AbstractUser with no additional fields
      - `Product`: Represents a product with a description, category (choices provided), price, quantity, photo URL, and creation timestamp
      - `Like`: Tracks which users like which products, with a unique constraint on the user-product pair
      - `Cart`: One-to-one relationship with User, includes methods to get total items and total price
      - `CartItem`: Represents items in a cart, linked to Cart and Product, with a quantity field
      - `Order`: Linked to Cart, includes fields for payment status, order placement timestamp, payment intent ID, amount, and a method to get the total payment.
5. `urls.py`
      - This urlpatterns list defines the routing paths for URLs in a Django application:
  
   |       url                 | description                                                         |

6. `views.py`
      - The views.py file in a Django application serves as the backbone, defining various view functions that handle different aspects of the application's functionality. Each view function is responsible for processing requests, interacting with the database through models, and rendering appropriate responses or templates to users. All functions are defined as follows:

__**js:**__
1. `index.js`
      - This script is responsible for handling the `like` functionality on an e-commerce website. When a user clicks a like button for a product, it sends a request to the server Django to update the `like` status. Depending on the response, it updates the UI to reflect whether the product is liked or not by toggling a liked class on the corresponding `heart` icon. The script includes error handling to log any issues that occur during the process.

# 6. Agile User Stories:
1. As a visitor, I can surf the website and look for products that I want
2. As a registered user, I can
   - Save items in my cart for future purchase.
   - Remove unwanted items from my cart
   - Add items to my cart
   - View all items in my cart before and after completing a transaction
   - Conduct online transactions
   - Contact sales representatives via email for any complaints
   - Interact with the chatbot to check the status of my current order
   - Review my purchase history
   - Write product reviews
Indicate preferences by liking or disliking a product.
1. As an admin person or a general manager, I can
    - Access and review all current registered users' purchase histories and account information (excluding passwords)
   - View all available products
   - Perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products

# 7. Constraints:
1. The implementation of the `like` icon in product_details.html is currently not fully effective in handling multiple clicks on a particular product. To revert the like icon to its original state, users may need to refresh the page.
2.
