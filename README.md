# 2. File Contents: .html, .py, .js Extensions

### html:

A) User Route:

0. `layout.html`:
   
     - Template Inheritance: It sets up blocks that other templates can inherit using {% extends "eCoffee/layout.html" %}. This allows consistent structure and styling across multiple pages
     - Navigation Bar: Includes a navigation bar that provides links to various routes:
         - eCoffee: Likely the homepage or main section of the website
         - Login: Link to the login page for user authentication
         - Register: Link to the registration page for new users
         - Profile: Link to the user's profile page for managing personal information
         - Cart Icon: Displays an icon associated with the user's cart, showing the total number of items currently in the cart. This allows quick access and visibility of cart contents
  
1. `index.html`   
     - displays the intro. page of the eCoffee website

2. `home_products.html` 
     - Displays all products currently in the system
     - Adds a checkbox functionality to filter products as desired
     - Includes the pagination functionality at the end of the page
3. `cart.html`
     - Displays Selected Items: It lists all selected items from the user's cart, allowing them to increase, decrease quantities, or remove items entirely
     - Dynamic Updates: Based on user interactions (increasing, decreasing quantities, or removing items), the page dynamically updates the sub-total, taxes, and total amounts to reflect these changes
     - Checkout Button: It provides a prominent "Continue to Checkout" button, enabling users to proceed to payment services, indicating readiness to complete their purchase
4. `create_checkout_session.html`
     - The file includes a script tag that initiates the process for a user to checkout and make a payment for their selected items. This tag triggers the Stripe template sheet for payment, sets up a click handler for a checkout button, sends a POST request to create a Stripe checkout session, and then redirects the user to the Stripe Checkout page. It also handles errors by logging them and redirecting the user to a failure page
     - Session parameters contain
         - Line items: Products being purchased
         - Payment details: Amount to be charged, currency, total items in cart
         - Success and failure URLs directions 
     - Return Session ID: Sends back the session ID or URL to the client-side, typically as a JSON response   
   
5. `success_transaction.html`
     - Displays a success transaction message and allows user to go back to HomePage
6. `failure_transaction.html`
     - Displays a reason for a failure transaction and leads user back to the HomePage
   
7. `product_details.html`
     - Shows the product information in greater details
     - Allows user to add the item; increase, decrease the number of the particular item; or remove all of them at once
8.  `profile.html`
     -  Mainly displays the info all of the items which were purchased based on `order_id` including amount paid for the order
    
B) Admin Route: 

1. `main_dashboard.html`
      - contains all sections of the admin route, encompassing admin dashboard, admin products and admin user pages for convenient navigation
      - adds a script tag that utilizes `chart.js` for generating a sales report chart
  
2.  `admin_products.html` 
      - displays all current products encompassing the CRUD operations 
      - adds Pagination functionality at the end of the page
3.  `admin_user.html` 
      - shows all registered users excluding the admin user

### py:
1. `admin.py`:
      - This file registers the `User, Product, Cart, CartItem, Like, Order,OrderItem, and OrderAdmin` models with the Django admin site. As a result, these models can be managed via the Django admin interface, allowing administrators to view, add, modify, and delete instances of these models through a web-based interface
      - The `OrderAdmin` class is created in this file that is used to manage how the model `Order` is diplayed and importantly will be customised in the Django admin interface. The fields selected are `'cart', 'payment_status', 'placed_order_at', 'payment_intent_id', 'amount'`
  
2. `context_processors.py`
      - Defines a context processor function `send_cart_length` that provides cart-related information to all **templates**. Specifically, it adds the total number of items in the cart (cart_length) and the total price of the items in the cart (total) to the context. This function is registered in the settings.py as follows
  
      ```python
            ...
            'context_processors': [
                ...
                'eCoffee.context_processors.send_cart_length'
            ],
      ```
3. `forms.py`
      - The forms.py file defines a:
         -  `ProductForm`class that inherits from forms.ModelForm. This form is used to create or update instances of the Product model

         - The Meta class within ProductForm specifies that the form is based on the Product model. The form includes the fields `description, category, price, quantity, and photo_url` from the `Product` model. The Django form itself serves as a `Constructor` of the `Product` class

         - `OrderForm` class is used to create a custom form for the Django admin interface specifically to allow for a customizable placed_order_at field for testing sales report purposes
         - The Meta class includes all fields `(fields = '__all__')` from the Order model
  
4. `models.py`

      - `User`: Extends AbstractUser with no additional fields
      - `Product`: Represents a product with a description, category (choices provided), price, quantity, photo URL, and creation timestamp
      - `Like`: Tracks which users like which products, with a unique constraint on the user-product pair
      - `Cart`: One-to-one relationship with User, includes methods to get total items and total price
      - `CartItem`: Represents items in a cart, linked to Cart and Product, with a quantity field
      - `Order`: Is linked to Cart, includes fields for payment status, order placement timestamp, payment intent ID, amount, and a method to get the total payment
      - `OrderItem`: Is linked to CartItem, includes all info about the purchased items. The model is used to saved all purchased items for each order and to retrieve for later review
5. `urls.py`
      This urlpatterns list defines the routing paths for URLs in a Django application:

  
   |       url                 | description                                                         | 
   |     --------              | ----------                                                          |

6. `views.py`
      - The views.py file in a Django application serves as the backbone, defining various view functions that handle different aspects of the application's functionality. Each view function is responsible for processing requests, interacting with the database through models, and rendering appropriate responses or templates to users. All functions are defined as follows:

### js:
1. `index.js`
      - There are a few functionalities:
         - First, one script is responsible for handling the `like` functionality on an e-commerce website. When a user clicks a like button for a product, it sends a request to the server Django to update the `like` status. Depending on the response, it updates the UI to reflect whether the product is liked or not by toggling a liked class on the corresponding `heart` icon. The script includes error handling to log any issues that occur during the process.
         - Second, a function call `getSalesData()` that is used for:
            - fetching monthly sales data from `/api/sales-data` backend Django
            - rendering a Chart.js bar chart (myChart) on main_dashboard.html using fetched data
            - using JavaScript to dynamically update the chart with monthly sales data
